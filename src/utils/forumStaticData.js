Ever since, I have been meditating 20 minutes a day and trying to run for at least 20 minutes. This is regularized my periods and has made the pain so much more manageable',

                comment: 'Stress and lifestyle has a great impact on health--be it cancer, periods or mental health. To stay fit as a woman and to take care of your menstrual health--have a healthy work-life balance. Do at least 30 minutes of cardio, try doing some light weights on non-menstrual days, keep a healthy friends and relatives circle you can fall back on, and manage stress better. Join a community of other women who can help you with your journey and inspire you to take care of yourself better. Do not restrict yourself, but look out for yourself at the same time. Visit your doctor who can recommend quick tips on how to stay healthy and fit based on your medical history',

                comment: 'I am almost reaching menopause, and Ihave learned that there is no “ideal period” Each period is different from the other. Any cycle length between 28-31 days is the sign of a healthy body. Sometimes delays or advances are normal too. Duration lasts any between 3-7 days and sometimes more. Do not compare your cycles with other women since they are all different. See a doctor if they are very irregular',
